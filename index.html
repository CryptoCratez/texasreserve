          Texas Reserve: The Hedge against Hyperinflation
        </h2>
        <div class="main-text multi-column">
          <p>
          Hyperinflation was a major economic problem that occurred in the Weimar Republic of Germany during the early 1920s. It was caused by a combination of factors, including the government's decision to print large amounts of money to pay for the costs of World War I, the loss of productive capacity due to the war, and the heavy reparations demanded by the Treaty of Versailles.Hyperinflation was a major economic problem that occurred in the Weimar Republic of Germany during the early 1920s. It was caused by a combination of factors, including the government's decision to print large amounts of money to pay for the costs of World War I, the loss of productive capacity due to the war, and the heavy reparations demanded by the Treaty of Versailles.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of these factors, the supply of German marks in circulation increased rapidly, while the economy struggled to keep up with the demand for goods and services. This led to a situation where prices rose rapidly, sometimes on a daily or even hourly basis, making it difficult for people to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, and clothing.
          </p>
          <p>
           At its peak in November 1923, prices in Germany were doubling every two days. Workers were paid multiple times a day so they could buy goods before prices rose even further. People used wheelbarrows of cash to buy basic goods, and bartering became more common as the currency became worthless.
</p>
          <p>
            Hyperinflation had a devastating impact on the German economy and society. It wiped out the savings of many Germans and destroyed the middle class, while benefiting those who held tangible assets like property, stocks, and gold. It also led to social unrest, as workers went on strike and people protested against the government.

The hyperinflation crisis was eventually resolved when the government introduced a new currency, the Rentenmark, which was backed by land and industrial assets. The government also instituted economic reforms, including measures to balance the budget, reduce spending, and control the money supply.

              In the event of hyper inflation gold would SHOOT through the roof as the value of the dollar fell exponentially.

This is why Texas Senate Introduced House Bill 4903

As a way to restore "Sound Money" as described in the constitution, and give Texans the authority of sovereign wealth again.
This would still require the centralized control of the Texas Comptroller, and i believe this choice was made out of ignorance for blockchain technology and what we can accomplish with it.


We will follow the framework of house bill 4903 and follow regulatory process in the context of the SEC. This means ultimately the goal will be to pass off control and ownership of the project to The State of Texas and The Comptroller.

 

We want to inspire results that dont let hyper inflation and weimar republic reminiscent government habits take down the great state, and what once was its own great country, of Texas

                of infant children by Iraqi soldiers by pulling them from
                incubators to die. Her testimony was instantly believed at the
